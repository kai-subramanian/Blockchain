# blockchain
A basic simulation of the code, already available from https://medium.com/programmers-blockchain/create-simple-blockchain-java-tutorial-from-scratch-6eeed3cb03fa
\n
To the only 2 people who will ever see and read this:
The code is already available, but i merely changed a few variable names, just to understand how the code works. I'm sure you guys can understand, too. I've attached some sample output snips for you guys to get a better picture. I used Eclipse IDE, if it helps.
